# How To Test Our App

## System requirements:
Testers would need to install the latest version of Node.js. Download it from the official website as linked
macOS, Windows (Powershell and WSL 2), and Linux are supported.

## Setup:
1. Clone the repo onto your local machine.
2. Using terminal, go into the directory where the repo is located on your local machine
3. Run the following command, “npm install”. This should install the dependencies required for the app to run
4. To start running the app, run the command, “npm start”, into your terminal. A qr code should popup in your terminal. 
5. At this point, the tester can either download Xcode on their macOS system or download the Expo Go app on their mobile device.
  * Xcode - With Xcode installed, after step 4, press i in the terminal to load the app into the Xcode ios simulator. The app should load onto the simulator. If it does not, refresh the server by pressing ‘r’ into the terminal.
  * With Expo Go downloaded on your device, after step 4, scan the QR code above with Expo Go (Android) or the Camera app (iOS). This should load up the app on your respective device. If it does not, refresh the server by pressing ‘r’ into terminal.
6. You should be all good to go!
